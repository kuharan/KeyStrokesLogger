# Key Strokes Logger
Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing,
is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard,
typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware
that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by
the person operating the logging program. A keylogger can be either software or hardware.

# Usage
While the programs themselves are legal, with many of them being designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers,
keyloggers are most often used for the purpose of stealing passwords and other confidential information.

Keylogging can also be used to study humanâ€“computer interaction. 
Numerous keylogging methods exist: they range from hardware and
software-based approaches to acoustic analysis.
